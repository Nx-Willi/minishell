# ðŸ–± 42Paris Project | minishell

## Objectives

The goal of this project is to make a "little" shell.  
We take bash for reference to manage comportements.  
We have to make the following built-ins:  
- **echo** with option -n  
- **cd** with only a relative or absolute path  
- **pwd** with no options  
- **export** with no options  
- **unset** with no options  
- **env** with no options or arguments  
- **exit** with no options  

Manage the following redirections:  
- **<** should redirect input.  
- **>** should redirect output.  
- **<<** should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the  
- delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!  
- **>>** should redirect output in append mode.  

Implement **pipes** (in our project a little mistake is made, we open all pipes before executing commands (it's a very big mistake), all pipes have to be open when it's used because a limit exists on the opened file descriptors and when you want to launch a lot of commands (above the limits of open file descriptors) our program make an undefined behavior... (oops)).  

Handle **environment variables**.  
Handle **ctrl-C**, **ctrl-D** and **ctrl-\\** which should behave like in bash.  
In interactive mode:  
- CTRL-C displays a new prompt on a new line.  
- CTRL-D exits the shell.  
- CTRL-\ does nothing.  

## Usage

`make` to compile the program.  
`clean` to clean objects files.  
`fclean` to clean objects files and program file.  

**Execute**: `./minishell`
